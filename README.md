# Olympic Data Project

## Overview
This project involves creating ETL pipelines using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to analyze and report on Olympic data, including athlete performance, medal counts, and historical statistics.

## Project Structure
- **Build SSIS Pipelines**: Contains the main SSIS tasks. Each folder includes more information about the specific tasks performed.
- **SQL Documentation**: Includes SQL scripts and insights related to the Olympic data. Each file contains detailed information about the queries and their purposes.
- **Olympic Data Requirements**: Lists the requirements for handling and processing Olympic data.
- **Business Report**: Contains three reports along with their details.

## Getting Started
To set up the project, clone the repository and open the solution in SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). 

Ensure you have the necessary database connections and permissions to run the SSIS packages.

Follow the Olympic data instructions and requirements.

## Usage
Each task within the "Build SSIS Pipelines" folder can be run independently to perform specific data operations.

Review the SQL documentation for queries and insights that can be utilized for reporting.

Also, review "Build SSIS Pipelines" for more information about each task, "Business Reports" for details on each SQL report and "SQL Documentation" for details on each SQL script.
